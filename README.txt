Welcome to the Sudoers' Point-Of-Sale System!

Some things to note about our program:
- There are two main methods: one for the CLI (command line) version of our program, and the other for the GUI (which is currently unfinished). In Netbeans, the CLI version should run by default. If that's not the case, then just run the program using the main() found in Sale.java. For the GUI, use the main() found in LoginWindow.java.

Other than that, enjoy the program! The GUI version should be up and running by the next deliverable stage.

Love,
The Sudoers
